WebDAV on Windows Server 2003 allowed an end-user to manipulate files and
folders on a web server using forms authentication. When switching to Server
2008, WebDAV required Windows Authentication, and it became necessary to find
a way to replicate Explorer-like functionality on a website to a folder on the
web server.

I created the jQuery File Explorer to do just that. It provides a basic
interface for file and folder manipulation on the server.

I wrote the back-end script in Classic ASP because I feel like it's the easiest
language to translate into whatever server-side language you're using.

If you do translate the back-end, I would appreciate if you sent that to me so
I can include it in the repo for others to use as well.

If you enjoy this plugin please feel free to let me know at my e-mail address
listed above. Please also let me know if you have questions, comments,
suggestions, etc.

Thank you for using the jQuery File Explorer plugin!
